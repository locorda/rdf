/// Canonical RDF Dataset Implementation
///
/// Provides a wrapper around [RdfDataset] that implements semantic equality and
/// hashing based on RDF canonicalization. This class offers the same functionality
/// as [RdfDataset] but with equality and hash code operations that are based on
/// the canonical serialized form rather than syntactic triple matching.
///
/// ## Key Differences from RdfDataset
///
/// - **Semantic equality**: Two [CanonicalRdfDataset] instances are equal if they
///   represent the same RDF data semantically, even with different blank node labels
/// - **Consistent hashing**: Hash code is computed from the canonical form, ensuring
///   semantically equivalent datasets have the same hash
/// - **Performance trade-off**: Equality and hashing operations are more expensive
///   due to canonicalization, but provide true semantic equivalence
///
/// ## When to Use
///
/// Use [CanonicalRdfDataset] when:
/// - You need semantic equality for datasets that may have different blank node labels
/// - You want to use datasets as keys in maps or elements in sets with semantic equality
/// - You're implementing algorithms that require RDF graph isomorphism
///
/// For performance-critical scenarios where syntactic equality is sufficient,
/// use [RdfDataset] directly.
///
/// ## Canonicalization
///
/// The canonical form is computed using the RDF Canonicalization algorithm as specified
/// in the [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/) specification.
/// The canonical N-Quads representation is computed lazily and cached for performance.
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:locorda_rdf_canonicalization/canonicalization.dart';
/// import 'package:locorda_rdf_canonicalization/src/canonical/canonical_rdf_dataset.dart';
///
/// // Create datasets with different blank node labels but same structure
/// final dataset1 = RdfDataset.withDefaultGraph(RdfGraph(triples: [
///   Triple(BlankNodeTerm(), foaf.name, LiteralTerm.string('John'))
/// ]));
/// final dataset2 = RdfDataset.withDefaultGraph(RdfGraph(triples: [
///   Triple(BlankNodeTerm(), foaf.name, LiteralTerm.string('John'))
/// ]));
///
/// // Syntactic comparison
/// assert(dataset1 != dataset2); // Different blank node instances
///
/// // Semantic comparison using canonical wrapper
/// final canonical1 = CanonicalRdfDataset(dataset1);
/// final canonical2 = CanonicalRdfDataset(dataset2);
/// assert(canonical1 == canonical2); // Semantically equivalent
///
/// // Can be used as map keys with semantic equality
/// final Map<CanonicalRdfDataset, String> semanticMap = {
///   canonical1: 'First dataset',
///   canonical2: 'Same as first', // Will overwrite due to equality
/// };
/// assert(semanticMap.length == 1);
/// ```
///
/// See [RdfDataset] documentation for detailed information about dataset operations,
/// as this class delegates all dataset functionality to the wrapped instance.

/// A wrapper around [RdfDataset] that provides semantic equality and hashing
/// based on RDF canonicalization.
///
/// This class implements all the same operations as [RdfDataset] by delegation,
/// but overrides equality and hash code operations to use the canonical
/// serialized form. This ensures that two datasets with the same semantic
/// content but different blank node labels are considered equal.
///
/// The canonical form is computed lazily using the RDF Dataset Canonicalization
/// algorithm with exactly-once semantics. The first access to [canonicalNQuads],
/// [hashCode], or [operator ==] will trigger canonicalization; subsequent operations
/// access the cached result with zero overhead.
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// - **First access**: Expensive due to canonicalization computation (exactly once, thread-safe)
/// - **Subsequent access**: Zero overhead - direct field access with no synchronization
/// - **Memory usage**: Additional memory for cached canonical form
/// - **Thread safety**: Fully thread-safe. Concurrent first access will block until
///   computation completes, ensuring exactly-once evaluation. No synchronization overhead
///   on subsequent accesses.
///
/// ## Delegation Pattern
///
/// All dataset operations (graph access, iteration, etc.) are delegated to the
/// wrapped [RdfDataset] instance, so performance characteristics match the
/// underlying implementation except for equality and hashing operations.
