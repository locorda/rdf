/// Interface for encoding RDF graphs to different serialization formats.
///
/// This base class defines the contract for encoding RDF graphs into textual
/// representations using various formats like Turtle, JSON-LD, etc. It's part of
/// the Strategy pattern implementation that allows the library to support multiple
/// encoding formats.
///
/// Format-specific encoders should extend this base class to be registered
/// with the RDF library's codec framework.
///
/// Encoders are responsible for:
/// - Determining how to represent triples in their specific format
/// - Handling namespace prefixes and base URIs
/// - Applying format-specific optimizations for readability or size

  /// Encodes an RDF graph to a string representation in a specific format.
  ///
  /// Transforms an in-memory RDF graph into an encoded text format that can be
  /// stored or transmitted. The exact output format depends on the implementing class.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [graph] The RDF graph to encode.
  /// - [baseUri] Optional base URI for resolving/shortening IRIs in the output.
  ///   When provided, the encoder may use this to produce more compact output.
  ///
  /// Returns:
  /// - The serialized representation of the graph as a string.

  /// Creates a new encoder instance with the specified options.
  ///
  /// This method follows the Builder pattern to create a new encoder configured with
  /// the given options. It allows for customizing the encoding behavior without
  /// modifying the original encoder instance.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [options] The encoder options to apply, including [RdfGraphEncoderOptions.customPrefixes] for
  ///   namespace handling.
  ///
  /// Returns:
  /// - A new encoder instance with the specified options applied.
