/// Interfaces for XML parsing and related operations
///
/// This file provides abstractions for XML document parsing and processing,
/// enabling dependency injection and better testability of the RDF/XML parser.
///
/// These interfaces decouple the RDF/XML parser from specific implementations of:
/// - XML document parsing and processing
/// - URI resolution strategies
/// - Blank node management
///
/// The use of these interfaces follows the Dependency Inversion Principle,
/// making the parser more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to different
/// environments and requirements.
