/// Core service for mapping between Dart objects and RDF representations.
///
/// The RdfMapperService handles the complete workflow of serializing and deserializing
/// domain objects to and from RDF graphs. It acts as the central coordinator in the
/// mapping process, delegating to registered mappers and managing the serialization
/// and deserialization contexts.
///
/// This service is the bridge between the higher-level API (like RdfMapper) and
/// the actual implementation of the mapping operations. It encapsulates the core
/// mapping logic while depending on the registry for mapper resolution.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Creating appropriate serialization/deserialization contexts
/// - Managing the temporary registration of mappers
/// - Handling special cases like multi-object serialization
/// - Implementing the type resolution strategy
/// - Error handling during the mapping process
///
/// While this class can be used directly, it's typically accessed through the
/// higher-level abstractions like RdfMapper and GraphOperations.

  /// This method deserializes a single object from an RDF graph, identified by

  /// The deserialization process:
  /// 1. Creates a deserialization context with the provided graph
  /// 2. Looks up the appropriate deserializer for type T
  /// 3. Uses the deserializer to convert the RDF subject to a Dart object

  /// Optionally, a [register] callback can be provided to temporarily register
  /// custom mappers for this operation. The callback receives a clone of the registry.

  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// // Deserialize a person from a specific subject
  /// final person = service.deserializeBySubject<Person>(
  ///   graph,
  ///   const IriTerm('http://example.org/people/john'),
