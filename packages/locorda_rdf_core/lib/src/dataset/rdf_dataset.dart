/// RDF Dataset Implementation
///
/// Defines the [RdfDataset] class for managing collections of RDF graphs in named contexts.
/// This implementation provides the W3C RDF 1.1 Dataset specification for representing
/// and manipulating collections of RDF graphs.
///
/// ## RDF Dataset Concepts
///
/// An RDF dataset is a collection of RDF graphs with:
/// - One **default graph** (unnamed)
/// - Zero or more **named graphs**, each identified by an IRI
///
/// This aligns with the formal definition in RDF 1.1 specification where a dataset
/// is a mathematical structure containing exactly one default graph and zero or more
/// named graphs, where each named graph is a pair of an IRI and an RDF graph.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Immutable data structure** for thread-safety and predictability
/// - **Named graph management** with IRI-based identification
/// - **Default graph handling** for graph-level statements
/// - **Flexible constructors** for different initialization patterns
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ### Basic Dataset Creation
///
/// ```dart
/// // Empty dataset
/// final dataset = RdfDataset.empty();
///
/// // Dataset with only a default graph
/// final defaultGraph = RdfGraph(triples: [triple1, triple2]);
/// final dataset = RdfDataset.withDefaultGraph(defaultGraph);
///
/// // Dataset with named graphs
/// final namedGraphs = [
///   RdfNamedGraph(IriTerm('http://example.org/graph1'), graph1),
///   RdfNamedGraph(IriTerm('http://example.org/graph2'), graph2),
/// ];
/// final dataset = RdfDataset.withGraphs(namedGraphs);
/// ```
///
/// ### Working with Named Graphs
///
/// ```dart
/// // Check if a named graph exists
/// final graphName = IriTerm('http://example.org/people');
/// if (dataset.containsGraph(graphName)) {
///   final graph = dataset.graph(graphName);
///   // Work with the graph...
/// }
///
/// // Iterate over all named graphs
/// for (final namedGraph in dataset.namedGraphs) {
///   print('Graph: ${namedGraph.name}');
///   print('Triples: ${namedGraph.graph.size}');
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Relationship to RDF Standards
///
/// This implementation follows:
/// - [RDF 1.1 Concepts - RDF Datasets](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset)
/// - [RDF 1.1 Semantics - Dataset Semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#dfn-rdf-dataset)
///
/// ## Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Graph lookup**: O(1) average case using HashMap
/// - **Graph enumeration**: O(n) where n is the number of named graphs
/// - **Memory usage**: Proportional to the sum of all graph sizes plus overhead
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// RdfDataset is immutable, making it inherently thread-safe for read operations.
/// All modification operations return new instances rather than modifying existing ones.
library rdf_dataset;

import 'package:locorda_rdf_core/core.dart';

/// Represents an immutable RDF dataset containing a default graph and named graphs
///
/// An RDF dataset is formally defined as a collection consisting of:
/// - Exactly one default graph (which may be empty)
/// - Zero or more named graphs, each identified by an IRI
///
/// This class provides functionality for:
/// - Creating datasets from graphs
/// - Accessing graphs by name or as collections
/// - Checking for graph existence
/// - Iterating over named graphs
///
/// The class follows immutability principles - all instances are read-only
/// and operations that would modify the dataset return new instances.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// - Named graphs are stored in a Map for O(1) lookup by IRI
/// - The default graph is always present (empty graph if not specified)
/// - Graph names must be IRIs as per RDF 1.1 specification
/// - Duplicate graph names are not allowed (Map ensures uniqueness)
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Create a dataset with both default and named graphs
/// final dataset = RdfDataset(
///   defaultGraph: myDefaultGraph,
///   namedGraphs: {
///     IriTerm('http://example.org/graph1'): graph1,
///     IriTerm('http://example.org/graph2'): graph2,
///   },
/// );
///
/// // Access graphs
/// final graph1 = dataset.graph(IriTerm('http://example.org/graph1'));
/// final allGraphNames = dataset.graphNames;
/// ```
final class RdfDataset {
  /// The default graph of this dataset
  ///
  /// The default graph is the unnamed graph in the dataset and is always present.
  /// It may be empty but never null. According to RDF 1.1 specification,
  /// every dataset has exactly one default graph.
  final RdfGraph defaultGraph;

  /// Internal storage for named graphs mapped by their IRI names
  ///
  /// This map provides O(1) lookup time for named graphs. The keys are
  /// IRI terms that uniquely identify each named graph in the dataset.
  final Map<RdfGraphName, RdfGraph> _namedGraphs;

  /// Creates an RDF dataset with the specified default graph and named graphs
  ///
  /// This is the primary constructor for creating datasets with full control
  /// over both the default graph and named graph collection.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [defaultGraph] The default (unnamed) graph for this dataset
  /// - [namedGraphs] Map of IRI names to their corresponding graphs
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final dataset = RdfDataset(
  ///   defaultGraph: myDefaultGraph,
  ///   namedGraphs: {
  ///     IriTerm('http://example.org/people'): peopleGraph,
  ///     IriTerm('http://example.org/places'): placesGraph,
